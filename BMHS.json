In truth, is made of two (or in a few tribes, three or even four) thick, interlocked toothed plates which, when opened, expose their mouth and a pair of eyes. This under-visage can be disturbing to other races, and so most traveling Drosera keep their plates closed, wearing fanciful wooden or ceramic masks in a vague mockery of most races’ facial structure. They have a set of air-holes on their necks that allow them to speak and breathe while their headplates are closed. Drosera prefer to eat meat to the exclusion of anything else, and they train their saplings in the art of the ambush from a young age. As they age, they take on more dangerous game with their sires, passing their skills down to the next generation. Finding work in civilized areas where their cannibalistic nature is not frowned upon is difficult, so drosera who leave their native jungles gravitate toward assassination work that allows them to take the lives (or limbs) of others."

No matter what a nychterid’s other vocation in life, within their communes, they share everything: living quarters, domestic labor, food, sexual partners and child-rearing responsibilities. Nychterids derive their surnames from their commune, which are chosen among its members, and can change when a new member is accepted into it. Nychterid children are given the surname of their birth commune until they join another.",
                           "This desire for relative insulation from others suits most nychterids just fine, as their resemblance to bats inspires a seemingly primal fear in folk, and they are often discriminated against, being thought to be harbingers of plague or disease, or the agents of vampires. This is, of course, ridiculous, and most nychterids maintain a diet of fruit and insects.",
